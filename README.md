# Himanshu Bhardwaz's Blog

A minimalist, fast-loading blog built with Astro and MDX where I share my thoughts on software engineering, web development, and technology. Inspired by [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev)'s minimalist approach and rebuilt from scratch with Astro in just 4 hours.

## Why This Blog?

This blog represents the latest evolution in my web development journey. My portfolio previously housed my blog content, but I've decided to separate concerns for the best experience. While going forward my main portfolio will use Go + HTMX for its server-driven approach, I've chosen Astro with MDX for my blog content to leverage its exceptional static site generation capabilities and type-safe content creation.
