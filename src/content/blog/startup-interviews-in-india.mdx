1. Introduction:
    - The startup dream: stock options, cutting-edge tech, and… 10 rounds of interviews?
    - What I thought startup interviews would be like vs. what actually happened.

2. Stage 1: The Recruiter Call – Hope vs. Reality:
    - "We love your profile!" (Translation: We found your LinkedIn after a desperate Boolean search.)
    - "Tell me about yourself!" (Me: Which version? The normal one or the one optimized for your JD?)

3. Stage 2: The DSA Gauntlet
    - Leetcode Medium: "Okay, fair."
    - Leetcode Hard: "Why do you hate me? Isnt this a front-end role?"
    - System Design Round: "Explain how you’d build a scalable notification service."
        - My Answer: "Uhh… Firebase?"
        - Interviewer: Silent Judging

4. Stage 3: The Live Coding Round – AKA 'Fight or Flight'
    - "You have 30 minutes to code a full-stack app."
    - "You cannot use Google."
    - "You cannot breathe too loudly."
    - Writes code that runs on the first try → "Hmm, this is too simple. Can you optimize?"
    - Writes code that fails → "Hmm, you should have tested it before running."

5. Stage 4: The Culture Fit Round – Where Lies Are Born
    - "Why do you want to join us?" → (Real answer: "Because you're hiring, and my landlord doesn’t accept ‘passion for coding’ as rent.")
    - "What are your weaknesses?" → (Me: "Sometimes I care too much… about not working after 8 PM.")
    - "We believe in a flexible work culture. Would you be open to occasional weekend work?" → (Me: "Of course! Nothing excites me more 
    than spending my Saturday fixing a bug introduced by someone who already quit." dead inside smile)

6. Stage 5: The Offer (or The Ghosting)
    - The dreaded "We'll get back to you."
    - If you hear "We’re still evaluating other candidates," you're out.
    - If you survive: "We’re excited to have you! Here’s an offer that matches your current salary!"
    - The negotiation battle: "Can you match my expectations?" vs. "Can you match our budget?"

7. Conclusion: Lessons Learned
    - Always ask for a clear hiring timeline.
    - Practice explaining your projects like you’re pitching to a goldfish.
    - No matter how well you do, HR will always say ‘We’ll get back to you.’
    - And finally, when in doubt… just say ‘It depends on the use case.’
