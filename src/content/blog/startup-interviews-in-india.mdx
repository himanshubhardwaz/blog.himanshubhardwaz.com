1. Introduction:
    - The startup dream: stock options, cutting-edge tech, and… 10 rounds of interviews?
    - What I thought startup interviews would be like vs. what actually happened.

2. Stage 1: The Recruiter Call – Hope vs. Reality:
    - Recruiter: "We love your profile!"
    - Me: "Oh wow, thanks!"
    - Recruiter: "One sec, let me just... find it... uh, what was your name again?"
    - "Tell me about yourself!" (Me: Which version? The normal one, the ‘LinkedIn-friendly’ one, or the one that perfectly aligns with your JD?)
    - "What are your salary expectations?" (Me: "What are yours?" 😏)

3. Stage 2: The DSA Gauntlet – A Test of Strength (and Patience)
    - Leetcode Medium: "Okay, fair."
    - Leetcode Hard: "Why do you hate me? Isnt this a front-end role?" : briefly considered faking an internet outage.
    - System Design Round:
        - Interviewer: "Explain how you’d build a scalable notification service."
        - Me: "Uhh… Firebase?"
        - Interviewer: Silence. Slow head tilt.
        - Me: Sweating "Or... Kafka? Distributed message queues? Magic?"

4. Stage 3: The Live Coding Round – AKA 'Fight or Flight'
    - "You have 30 minutes to code a full-stack app."
    - "You cannot use Google."
    - "You cannot breathe too loudly."
    - Writes code that runs on the first try → "Hmm, this is too simple. Can you optimize?"
    - Writes slightly optimized code → "Hmm, overcomplicated. Should’ve kept it simple."

5. Stage 4: The Culture Fit Round – Where Lies Are Born
    - "Why do you want to join us?" → (Real answer: "Because you're hiring, and my landlord doesn’t accept ‘passion for coding’ as rent.")
    - "What are your weaknesses?" → (Me: "Sometimes I care too much… about not working after 8 PM.")
    - "We believe in a flexible work culture. Would you be open to occasional weekend work?" → (Me: "Of course! Nothing excites me more 
    than spending my Saturday fixing a bug introduced by someone who already quit." dead inside smile)

6. Stage 5: The Offer (or The Ghosting)
    - The dreaded "We'll get back to you."
    - If you hear "We’re still evaluating other candidates," congrats, you’re out.
    - If you survive: "We’re excited to have you! Here’s an offer that matches your current salary!"
    - The negotiation battle: "Can you match my expectations?" vs. "Can you match our budget?"

7. Conclusion: Lessons Learned
    - Always ask for a clear hiring timeline.
    - Practice explaining your projects like you’re pitching to a goldfish.
    - No matter what the JD says, you will be asked DSA questions.
    - No matter how well you do, HR will always say ‘We’ll get back to you.’
    - And finally…
        - when in doubt… just say ‘It depends on the use case.’
        - If all else fails, fake a power cut.
