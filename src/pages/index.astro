      This is the place where I write about web development, tech experiments,
      and the occasional existential crisis over which JavaScript framework to
      use.

      At first, my portfolio and blog were a happy coupleâ€”until they realized
      they had creative differences. So, they amicably parted ways. Now, my
      portfolio is soon going to embrace Go + HTMX for that sleek, server-driven
      lifestyle, while my blog is chilling with Astro + MDX, enjoying type
      safety and static site generation like a true minimalist.

      Why the split? Because I enjoy overengineering things for <em>fun.</em>
