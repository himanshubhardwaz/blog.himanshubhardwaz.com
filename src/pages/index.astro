      This blog represents the latest evolution in my web development journey.
      My portfolio previously housed my blog content, but I've decided to
      separate concerns for the best experience. While I'm migrating my main
      portfolio to Go + HTMX for its server-driven approach and lightweight
      interactivity, I've chosen to keep my blog content on Astro with MDX. This
      combination gives me the best of both worlds - the type-safety and
      developer experience of MDX for content creation, combined with Astro's
      exceptional static site generation capabilities. I enjoy rewriting and
      experimenting with different tech stacks, and this split allows me to
      optimize each platform for its specific purpose without compromise.
